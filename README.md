## Project Requirements

This project was built for project three of General Assembly's Full-Stack Software Engineering course. The project aim was to build our a MERN stack website/application with own API, utilise our growing knowledge of React as well as connecting backend to frontend for the first time. The project specs allowed us to take inspiration from complex websites/apps that use data such as AirBnb or Facebook, and essentially rebuild it in our own way if we desire.

### Project aim 

BTJ is a fictional political space where people can express themselves on current affairs, history, philosophy and more.

The articles are accessed and avaliable to view by anyone, however only registered user can submit a submission. 

The functionality of BTJ includes:

- Submit an article when you are logged in


### Planning

Before the project: My planning started with creating a wireframe using Excalidraw, and speaking with my tutors on ideas that would be doable and sufficient for the project requirements.

During the project: I used Google Docs to keep a daily list of tasks I wanted to/needed to complete day by day, this helped me stay organised and know what to focus on as my next steps, whether that was asking a question from my tutors or implementing a function or styling etc. See example below:

### Build

Frontend: The project utilises React, HTML and CSS. I didn't use any styling frameworks for this project as I enjoy doing my own styling, however for future, I would like to learn how to use some CSS libaries of frameworks.

Backend: The backend of this project utilises Python, Django and Poetry package manager. I also used Insomnia to test my routes and understand my models/data.
